# Go Variable Declarations and Assignments

This project demonstrates various methods of declaring and assigning variables in Go, including multiple variable declarations, short declarations, and multiple assignments.

## Overview

The main Go file (`main.go`) covers:
- Declaring and initializing variables
- Redeclaring variables with short declaration syntax
- Declaring multiple variables using the `var` keyword
- Performing multiple assignments and swapping values
- Using expressions in short declarations

## Code Breakdown

### Variable Declarations and Initializations

```go
// Declare and initialize car and cost variables
car, cost := "Audi", 50000
fmt.Println(car, cost) // Output: Audi 50000

// Reassign car variable and declare a new year variable
car, year := "BMW", 2018
_ = year // Avoid unused variable warning
```

- `car` and `cost` are initialized and printed.
- `car` is reassigned, and a new variable `year` is declared. The `year` variable is not used, so it's muted with `_`.

### Redeclaration and Multiple Variables

```go
// Initialize and reassign opened and file variables
var opened = false
opened, file := true, "a.txt"
_, _ = opened, file // Avoid unused variable warnings

// Declare multiple variables with zero values
var (
    salary    float64
    firstName string
    gender    bool
)
fmt.Println(salary, firstName, gender) // Output: 0  false
```

- `opened` and `file` are reassigned using short declaration syntax.
- Multiple variables are declared with their zero values and printed.

### Multiple Variable Declarations

```go
// Declare multiple integer variables with zero values
var a, b, c int
fmt.Println(a, b, c) // Output: 0 0 0
```

- Multiple integers are declared and printed with their zero values.

### Multiple Assignments and Swapping Values

```go
// Initialize integer variables i and j
var i, j int
i, j = 5, 8

// Swap values of i and j
j, i = i, j
fmt.Println(i, j) // Output: 8 5
```

- Integer variables `i` and `j` are initialized and their values are swapped.

### Short Declarations with Expressions

```go
// Perform and print the sum of an integer and a float value
sum := 5 + 2.3
fmt.Println(sum) // Output: 7.3
```

- Demonstrates using an expression in a short declaration.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the program using `go run main.go` to see the outputs of various variable operations.

## Conclusion

This project showcases basic and advanced variable handling in Go, including different declaration methods and assignment operations. It provides a foundation for understanding variable management in Go programming.
