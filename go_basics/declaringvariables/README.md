# Variables in Go

## Overview

A **variable** is a name for a memory location where a value of a specific type is stored. In Go, a variable belongs to and is created at runtime. A declared variable must be used, or we get an error! The underscore `_` is the blank identifier and mutes the compile-time error returned by unused variables.

## Declaring Variables

### 1. Using the `var` Keyword

```go
var x int = 7
var s1 string
s1 = "Learning Go!"
```

### 2. Using the Short Declaration Operator `:=`

```go
age := 30
```

## Explanation of Variables in Go

In this lecture, we'll discuss variables:

1. **What is a variable**?
2. **How do we declare a variable**?
3. **How to use variables in Go**?

### What is a Variable?

A variable is one of the fundamental concepts of any programming language. No matter if we are programming in C, C++, Java, Python, or Go, we'll use variables to store the data the application is working with. Variables are how your program remembers values. A variable is a name for a memory location where a value of a specific type is stored.

### Declaring Variables

In Go, a variable belongs and is created at runtime; at compile time, it only knows the type of the variable but doesn't assign any value to it. 

#### Example in VSCode

In VSCode under `master_go_programming` directory, create another directory called `variable_basics` and inside this directory, a file called `main.go`.

In `main.go`, start creating the basic structure of any Go application. This file belongs to the `main` package, and also create the `main` function.

### Basic Structure of a Go Program

There are two ways to declare a variable in Go:
1. Using the `var` keyword
2. Using the short declaration operator `:=`

#### Using the `var` Keyword

To declare a variable called `age` of type `int`:

```go
var age int = 30
fmt.Println("Age:", age)
```

#### Type Inference

In Go, we can omit the type because Go can infer or deduce it from the right-hand side operand.

```go
var name = "Dan"
fmt.Println("Your name is:", name)
```

If the variable `name` is declared but not used, Go will return a compile-time error.

### Using the Short Declaration Operator `:=`

#### Example

```go
s1 := "Learning golang!"
fmt.Println(s1)

name = "Moffat"
name1 := "John"
_ = name1
```

The short declaration operator `:=` works only in block scope and is used when declaring new variables or at least one new variable. 

If you want to change the value of an already defined variable, use only the equal sign `=`.

#### Example with Short Declaration and Reassignment

```go
// Short declaration
name1 := "John"

// Reassignment
name = "Moffat"

// Suppress unused variable warning
_ = name1
```

## Conclusion

That's all about variable basics in Go. In the next lecture, we'll talk about multiple declarations.
